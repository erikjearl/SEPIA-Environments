# Programming Assignment 4

### The planner on our P4 project starts malfunctioning with the implementation of parallelism...
* This branch shows off a 'working' implementation of our code, capable of building multiple peasants and completing the map.
* This also shows off the code for our implementation of concurrent 'K-Actions' for the peasants.

> We included in our code's comments addtional strategies attempted to implemented the desired concurrent acitions
> Mainily, an alternate generate children functio to generate multiple actions at once so our A* could weigh the value of agents doing different tasks
> by weighing best resources and creating new possible states inheriting previous state attributes.

Ultimently we were unable to create a fully functioning implementation, so were presenting the state that shows off the most functionality.
